## Exercise: Create a Spring Application with Spring Initializr

### Description:

In this exercise, we will utilize the Spring Initializr website to create a Spring Boot application. The application will be configured to listen on port 7575 and will feature a REST controller with three distinct endpoints. Additionally, we will expose all actuator endpoints. To enhance the development process, we'll configure the application for automatic reload upon making changes.

### Instructions:

1. Visit the Spring Initializr website
      -	Configure the project with the necessary dependencies, including Spring Web.
      -	Set the project metadata and download the generated project.
2. Configure Port:
      -	Set the server port to 7575
3. Create REST Controller:
      -	Create a new Java class for the REST controller.
      -	Implement three different endpoints, each serving a distinct purpose.
4. Expose Actuator Endpoints.
5. Implement Automatic Reload.
